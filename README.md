Throne
===============================================

Conquer Online emulator in development.

Written in C#, currently targeted at the patches of late 2014. 
The goal of the Throne project aims to create a stable server platform for Conquer Online.

Currently, I would call the project "confused"
There are, in a few cases.. different implementations of the same thing. 
I'm still learning new, better, cooler ways to do things in C#, so the project isn't pure as I would like.

Development was originally Mono, but moved to Visual Studio. The project could be ported with some effort.

Features
--------
 - Split server... Login and World

   - Actor based threading
 - Conquer Implementations:
   - Roles

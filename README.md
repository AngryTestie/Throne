Throne
===============================================

Conquer Online emulator in development.

Written in C#, currently targeted at the patches of late 2014. 
The goal of the Throne project aims to create a stable server platform for Conquer Online.

Currently, I would call the project "confused"
There are, in a few cases.. different implementations of the same thing.
For instance, there are two methods of configuration...
***Text files and VS .settings/resx. (Eventually everything will be text files)
Two ways of handling exceptions.
***Event manager and the logger's "register exception" method.
